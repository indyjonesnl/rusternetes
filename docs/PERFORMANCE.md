# Performance & Footprint

The "k3s without melting your laptop" thesis rests on a number nobody had
measured. This page is the home for those numbers and how to reproduce them.

## Why this matters

Footprint — idle RAM in particular — is the north-star for the lightweight-distro
positioning (see `indy/ROADMAP.md`). Two structural bets depend on having a
measurable baseline first:

- **In-process watch event bus (#1039)** — replace the apiserver-watch-cache
  HTTP hop for in-process consumers; expected to cut idle apiserver memory
  (watch-cache ring buffers). The before/after is meaningless without this
  baseline.
- **Adaptive / event-driven reconcile (#1040)** — cut idle CPU from controller
  polling.

Risk noted in #1038: `etcd-client`, `bollard`, `smoltcp`, and full `tokio` are
compiled into the all-in-one unconditionally, so the current footprint may not
yet beat k3s. **Measure before claiming.**

## Competitive bar (idle RAM)

| Distro | Idle RAM |
|---|---|
| k3s | ~535–750 MB (≈1–1.2 GB without `GOMEMLIMIT`) |
| k0s | ~658 MB |
| microk8s (HA off) | ~526 MB |
| OS baseline | ~167 MB |

Target to claim the niche: **sub-400 MB idle** (stretch 250–300 MB).

## Dimensions

1. **Binary size** — release `rusternetes` all-in-one, raw + stripped (and a
   `musl` static variant).
2. **Time-to-cluster** — `compose up` → first node `Ready`.
3. **Idle control-plane RSS** — single node, default CNI + DNS, no workload.
4. **Idle CPU %** — same window.

## Reproduce

```bash
# Everything (builds release, boots compose.all-in-one.yml, samples idle):
bash scripts/footprint-benchmark.sh

# Binary size only (no Docker needed):
bash scripts/footprint-benchmark.sh --size-only

# Longer idle sample window:
bash scripts/footprint-benchmark.sh --seconds 60
```

Process-level idle RSS of the all-in-one binary (used by the #1039 before/after)
is also available standalone:

```bash
cargo build --release -p rusternetes
scripts/bench-idle-memory.sh --seconds 60
```

For the musl static binary:

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
# A musl C toolchain is required for the cc-based deps (aws-lc-sys, ring,
# libsqlite3-sys): apt-get install musl-tools, then point cc at it.
CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=musl-gcc \
  cargo build --release -p rusternetes --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
# (release profile already strips; no separate `strip` step needed)
```

> Prereq: the build must be **OpenSSL-free**. Until #1041's rustls-only change,
> `prometheus-http-query`/`reqwest` default features pulled `openssl-sys`, whose
> build script has no musl cross-build — the musl build failed there. With
> OpenSSL dropped the static build proceeds.
>
> **arm64 (`aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`)** additionally needs an aarch64 musl
> cross C toolchain (`aarch64-linux-musl-gcc`) for those same cc-based deps; the
> Rust target alone is not enough.
>
> To skip the cross toolchain entirely, build the static image instead of a
> cross-compiled binary — its Alpine builder is musl-native, so on arm64
> hardware the host target already *is* `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`:
>
> ```bash
> docker build -f all-in-one-musl.Dockerfile -t rusternetes-all-in-one:musl .
> ```
>
> `.github/workflows/publish-musl-image.yml` does exactly this on a native
> runner per arch and publishes the two as one multi-arch manifest
> (`ghcr.io/indyjonesnl/rusternetes/all-in-one-musl:musl`), so an arm64 static
> binary is a `docker pull` away:
>
> ```bash
> docker create --platform linux/arm64 \
>   ghcr.io/indyjonesnl/rusternetes/all-in-one-musl:musl   # then `docker cp <id>:/rusternetes .`
> ```

## Results

Reference hardware: _TBD (record CPU/RAM/OS when filling this in)_.

| Metric | rusternetes | k3s | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Binary size (release, glibc) | **75.1 MiB** | — | dynamically linked; the release profile already strips symbols, so raw == stripped |
| Binary size (musl, static) | **82.4 MiB** | ~70 MB | static-pie, stripped, self-contained (no glibc) |
| Time-to-cluster | TBD | TBD | `up` → first node Ready |
| Idle RSS (avg) | TBD | ~535–750 MB | all-in-one container |
| Idle RSS (max) | TBD | — | |
| Idle CPU (avg) | TBD | TBD | |

The all-in-one binary — 75 MiB glibc-dynamic, 82 MiB musl-static (fully
self-contained, no glibc) — is in the same ballpark as k3s's ~70 MB static
binary. But binary size is the *easy* dimension. The thesis lives or dies on
**idle RSS** (the `TBD` rows), which is why #1039/#1040 target it; measure those
before claiming the niche.

_Fill the remaining `TBD` cells from a `scripts/footprint-benchmark.sh` run plus
a k3s run on the same box._
