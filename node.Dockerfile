# A rusternetes node, kind-style: containerd (CRI + Youki + CNI) AND the kubelet
# in one container, so the kubelet and the runtime share a filesystem (required
# for flannel's hostPath CNI install and for pod hostPath volumes to resolve).
#
# Reuses two already-built images:
#   - the containerd runtime base (containerd.Dockerfile) for containerd/youki/CNI
#   - the kubelet image for the kubelet binary
# Both image refs are ARGs so the build can point at whatever tags exist (the
# compose build tags them per project).
